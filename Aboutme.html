                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h5>Software <span>Engineer</span></h5>
                <p>I am a highly accomplished, skilled and knowledgeable computer engineering graduate with extensive knowledge of programming and computer science applications. I love building tools and technologies for entrepreneurs, companies and organizations so they can succeed.

                    I use PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript, JQuery, Ajax or Wordpress to build websites. I also like to use Node.js and APIs to integrate third party tools into my projects. My preferred languages to code are Python, C#, Java and C++ but I can also code in any other language. At the moment I am using Anaconda and the numpy, scikit, matplotlib, plotly libraries to solve machine learning problems and visualize big datasets
                    
                    In my work as an engineer, I have had to use a lot of clunky and counter-intuitive software, curious as to why these programs works the way they do. I started teaching myself how to code almost immediately. i love the combination of creation and problem-solving skill I get to use when writing code, and I love how there is always more to learn.
